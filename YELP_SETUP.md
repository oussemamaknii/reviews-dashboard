## 🏗️ Current Query Structure

Your API now supports the exact format you requested:

```javascript
const url = 'https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search?sort_by=best_match&limit=20&term=apartments&location=London,UK&categories=apartments';
```

**Mapped to your endpoint:**

```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### 1. **Invalid API Key Format**
```
Error: 'Bearer YOUR_YELP_API_KEY_HERE' does not match '^(?i)Bearer [A-Za-z0-9\\-\\_]{128}$'
```
**Solution**: Replace placeholder with real 128-character API key

### 2. **404 Reviews Not Found**  
```
Error: Yelp API error: 404 - Resource could not be found
```
**Solution**: This is normal - many businesses don't have public reviews. The system falls back to business info.

### 3. **Rate Limiting**
```
Error: Yelp API error: 429 - Too Many Requests  
```
**Solution**: You're within free tier limits (5,000 calls/month)

Your integration now searches for:
- **Apartments** in London
- **Hotels** and short-term rentals
